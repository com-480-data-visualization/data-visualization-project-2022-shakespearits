      <h2>Shakespeare biography</h2>
      <p>
        William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. 
        He produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
        His early plays were comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. 
        Then, he wrote mainly tragedies until 1608. Among them, we can quote Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English language.
        In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies and collaborated with other playwrights.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this makes Shakespeare one of the greatest English writer and the world's greatest dramatist. 
        His works, including collaborations, consist of 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses. 
        His plays have been translated into many different languages and continue to be studied and reinterpreted.
      </p>
